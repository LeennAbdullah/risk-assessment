# risk-assessment
This is a case study about a UUuniversity that has a specific scenario and based on the scenario i have created the Asset repository system as a starting point to be 
able to track software, hadware and network component. Then specifies the potential risks in the university system by specifying the threats and give them relative 
values in order to be able to prioritize them based on the value that was assigned depending on many criteria such as if the threat requires any skills and if there 
are a presence of any of contralls that can metigate the threat and decrease its potentiality to occur, then the vulnerability inventory and the specifying the 
assets linked with the vulnerability. The threats and vulnerabilities are linked by TVA worksheet to see each threat what is the vulnerability that is likely to make it happen and on which asset is the danger. The last step was Ranking the Risk (threat+vulnerability) quantitivly based on calculations and prioritizing
which asset was mostly important for the organization.
