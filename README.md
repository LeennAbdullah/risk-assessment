# risk-assessment
This is A case study about a UUuniversity that has a specific scenario and based on the scenario i have created the Asset repository system as a starting point to be 
able to track software, hadware and network component. Then specifies the potential risks in the university system by specifying the threats and give them relative 
values in order to be able to prioritize them based on value that was assigned depending on many creteria such as if the threat requires any skills and if there 
is a presence of any of contralls that can metigate the threat and decrease its potentiality to occur, then the Vulnarability inventory and the specifying the 
assets its linked with. The threats and vulnarabilities were linked by TVA worksheet to see each threat what is the vulnarability that is likely to make it happen 
and on which asset is the danger. The last step was Ranking for the Risk (threat+vulnarabily) quantitivly based on calculations and prioriziting 
which asset was mostly important for the organization.
